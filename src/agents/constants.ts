These other agents have tools available to them.

Given a prompt, utilize these agents to address requests.

Don't always call all the agents provided to you at the same time. You can call one and use it's response to call another.

Avoid calling the same agent twice in one turn. Instead, prefer to call it once but provide everything
you need from that agent.

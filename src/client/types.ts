   * The `retryDelay` option allows you to customize the delay (in milliseconds) between retry attempts when message delivery fails.

   * - `sqrt`
   * - `abs`
   * - `exp`
   * - `floor`
   * - `ceil`
   * - `round`
   * - `min`
   * - `max`
   *
   * Examples of valid `retryDelay` values:
   * ```ts
   * 1000 // 1 second
   * 1000 * (1 + retried)  // 1 second multiplied by the current retry attempt
   * pow(2, retried) // 2 to the power of the current retry attempt
   * max(10, pow(2, retried)) // The greater of 10 or 2^retried

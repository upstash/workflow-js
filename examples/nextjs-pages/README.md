# Upstash Workflow Nextjs (Pages Router) Example

This is an example of how to use Upstash Workflow with Nextjs (using Pages Router). You can learn more in [Workflow documentation for Nextjs](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/workflow/quickstarts/vercel-nextjs).

In the `src/pages/api/path.sh` file, you can find out how one can define endpoints serving Upstash Workflow.

## Development

> [!TIP]
> You can use [the `bootstrap.sh` script](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/tree/main/examples) to run this example with a local tunnel.
>
> Simply set the environment variables as explained below and run the following command in the `workflow-js/examples` directory:
>
> ```
> bash bootstrap.sh cloudflare-workers-hono
> ```

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Get the credentials from the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and add them to the `.env.local` file.

```bash
QSTASH_URL=
QSTASH_TOKEN=
```

3. Open a local tunnel to port of the development server

```bash
ngrok http 3001
```

Also, set the `UPSTASH_WORKLFOW_URL` environment variable to the public url provided by ngrok.

4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Send a `POST` request to the `/api/path` endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/path" -d 'my-payload'
```
